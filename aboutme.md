My name is Jay Saptarshi and i am currently pursuing my masters in Computer Science from UNC Charlotte. I will graduate in May 2020 and i am looking for opportunities in Data Science, Data Engineer and Data Analytics.

I love playing sports and being outdoors. 

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
