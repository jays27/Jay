I recently graduated with my Master’s in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science and I am very much motivated to work in the field of Data and have statistical knowledge to compliment the same.

In my internship as a Jr. Data Analyst at TIAA, I worked to ensure that Data Governance and strategy requirements are effectively coordinated and applied within the Cybersecurity team. I implemented Data Quality checks on IBM Information Analyzer across the data warehouse. Also, running SQL scripts was an integrated part of my work to get a good knowledge of the. Creating statistical reports for the different business owners and actively participated in production of data rules across the schema.

In my Fall ‘19 semester, my capstone research project was in the area of Crime Prediction Analytics. Applying different machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Random Forest, Decision Trees to predict the type of crime. Tweaking the hyperparameters of the models and comparing accuracy, precision and recall for the algorithms. Also performing visual analytics to create a heat map to identify areas of city having high number of crime rates 

As a Graduate Research Assistant, I worked in the field of NLP and Information Retrieval. I worked with a team which conducted a research which creates a surprise recommendation system based on the user preference. I have used word embeddings and tf-idf model to create vectors and using point wise mutual information, we created a surprise recommendation model. We deployed the user study on Amazon S3 bucket and used Amazon Mechanical Turk for the user base. 

I also have an experience as a Financial Analyst and have used machine learning algorithms to create predictive models on asset management companies to assess their growth. I also have a Data Analyst experience where I created dashboards using visualization tools like Tableau.

I feel I am equipped with the necessary skills required such as being proficient in python, SQL, frameworks such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI and experience in model building and good vocal and written communication.
