•	BioAsq: Indexed 22GB of data which contained documents. Question Answering platform where Information Retrieval was done to extract documents for 2200 questions. Calculated Precision, Recall and F-score to measure the accuracy.

•	Stock Predictor: Time Series Prediction with LSTM, Recurrent Neural Network to predict the stock. The project was implemented in python with the use of keras module.

•	Tumor Classification: Supervised Learning classification project which helped in classifying whether tumor is present or not. The model was trained in Naïve Bayes and the project helped in classifying minute tumors which can be diagnosed and treated before it is a major tumor.
